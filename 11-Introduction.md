# Introduction

## What we need

* Examples use Python 3
* Editor with Python support
* You will get all material in a zip file shortly after the course

## Approach

We will use three components:

* documents (instead of slides), exploring topics
* code examples
* coding tasks
* questions (and answers) in a shared pad (etherpad)

We can (and should) detour into specific questions any time.

## Inspiration: Books on real software development, like "Clean Code" or the "Practice of Programming"

### Books

* [Clean Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/clean-code-a/9780136083238/)
* [The Practice of Programming](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~bwk/tpop.webpage/)
* [Clean Code in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/product/clean-code-in-python/9781788835831)
* [Refactoring](https://www.martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html)
* ...

### Clean code is not a single thing

* while popularized by Robert C. Martin, it is not *one thing*
* more like: "small things matter", or *small things add up*

> [...] attentiveness to detail is an even more critical
foundation of professionalism than is any grand vision [CC]

> Writing clean code requires the disciplined use of a **myriad little
> techniques** applied
through a painstakingly acquired sense of "cleanliness." [CC]

Inspiration comes from a broad literature on software engineering and other fields:

* Patterns research community (design patterns)
* Research Labs (e.g. Bell Labs)

Architecture:

* Christopher Alexander, A pattern language (1977)

Japanese production lines: Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) using **5S** (1950-1970):

* Seiri - "sort", "know where things are"
* Seiton - "systematize", "tidyness", a place for everything and everything in its place
* Seiso - "shine", keep the work place free of handing wires, waste, ...
* Seiketsu - "standardization", consensus on how the workplace is kept clean
* Shutsuke - "self-discipline", follow rules over time

Fred Brooks (IBM):

* rewrite every seven years (to cleanup up)
* example: an popular maps web application is at least at its second complete
  rewrite

Many practicioners can be be quoted (from various fields):

> preoccupation with *detail* is common to all endeavors of excellence

Interestingly, a classic CS education does not necessarily go into these kind
of (coding) details.

### Programming as a loser's game

* hypothesis: software development is *loser's game* ([article](https://thehosk.medium.com/software-development-is-a-losers-game-fc68bb30d7eb))
* analogy from (amateur and expert) tennis (Charles Ellis, 1970's, investing context)

> “In expert tennis, about 80 per cent of the points are won; in amateur
> tennis, about 80 per cent of the points are lost. In other words,
> professional tennis is a Winner’s Game — the final outcome is determined by
> the activities of the winner — and amateur tennis is a Loser’s Game — the
> final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser. The two games
> are, in their fundamental characteristic, not at all the same. They are
> opposites.” Charles Ellis

* you win by avoiding mistakes (and not necessarily by being extraordinary)

### Dogma

* while there are rules and techniques, following a dogma blindly will probably not help
* teams with underspecified process can win, teams working *by the book* can fail
* there is a balance between business and software needs, that is a challenge to find and keep
