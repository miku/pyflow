"""
Task: Find potential improvements in the following code. Name them and suggest an alternative.

Code implements a basic TicTacToe game.

Some ideas:

* make "." configurable, also maybe "x"
* "check" is too generic of a name
* no docstrings
* very repetetive check logic, hard to see whether it is correct
* while True plus extra condition within while
* could indent less in `tic_tac_toe`
