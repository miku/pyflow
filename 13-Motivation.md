# Motivation: Software that fits your problem

## Overengineering

> 20K LOC for something that may be command line tool

too much design for a problem

## Underengineering

* everything lives in function in a language that supports OO
* no functions at all (single file, top to bottom, 15K lines)

## Let us do the job before we get regulated

* software is [volatile](https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/02/20/requirements-volatility-is-the-core-problem-of-software-engineering/)
* first SW engineering conference took place in [1968](http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/NATOReports/)

# Software is still complex, software is a losers game

* you can win by just avoiding some bad practices

# Pragmatic Python

* Some patterns are not required, because Python is expressive
* Keep it pragmatic, use magic sparingly

# Clean Code critique

* stop recommending clean code: [article](https://qntm.org/clean)

# Disclaimer

## what do you prefer?

* clean code, no revenue, or
* spaghetti code making a million a month

## Writing software is a complex activity
