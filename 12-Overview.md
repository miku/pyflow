## What is clean code?

Before we dive in, what is our take?

* Please, go to the pad and answer briefly, or with keywords:

> Question: How would you describe clean code? Which properties would it have?

### What other people say

The Book let's a few people speak.

> I like my code to be elegant and efficient. The
logic should be straightforward to make it hard for bugs to hide, the
dependencies minimal to ease maintenance, error handling complete according to
an articulated strategy, and performance close to optimal so as not to tempt
people to make the code messy with unprincipled optimizations.

> **Clean code does one thing well.** -- Bjarne Stroustrup

> Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code
**reads like well-written prose**. Clean code never obscures the designer's intent
but rather is full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control.
-- Grady Booch

This emphasis of readability relates to *Readability counts.* from the Zen of
Python.


> Clean code can be read, and **enhanced** by a
developer other than its original author. It has **unit and acceptance tests**.
It has **meaningful names**. It provides **one way** rather than many ways for
doing one thing. It has **minimal dependencies**, which are explicitly defined,
and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending
on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code
alone. -- Dave Thomas

> I could list all of the qualities that I notice in
clean code, but there is one overarching quality that leads to all of them.
**Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares**. There is
nothing obvious that you can do to make it better. All of those things were
thought about by the code’s author, and if you try to imagine improvements,
you’re led back to where you are, sitting in appreciation of the code someone
left for you—code left by some- one who cares deeply about the craft. --
Michael Feathers

> You know you are working on clean code when each
routine you read turns out to be **pretty much what you expected**. You can call it
beautiful code when the code also makes it look like the language was made for
the problem. -- Ward Cunningham


### Software Engineering and Programming

Software engineering has been described as programming over time, subjected to
deadlines.

* Boy scout rule: Leave the campground cleaner than you found it

Imagine checking code in, that is a tiny bit cleaner, more streamlined, better
documented, with fewer bugs than at checkout time. Code would only get better.
